DIRECTIONS:-

Preheat oven to 350°.
In a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add sugar, stirring until combined. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.
Spray an 8"-x-8" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)
Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)
Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.
